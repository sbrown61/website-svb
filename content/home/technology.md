I have around 20 years' experience as a software developer, designing and building a wide variety of object-oriented libraries, databases, end-user applications, and back-end systems. Most of my work now is in direct support of my accounting research and data science activities.

### Programming Languages
|                         |                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Python                  | Especially Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy; around 75% of my machine learning/AI work is in Python, the rest is in R |
| R                       | I use the tidyverse approach where possible; most of my R development is for statistical analysis and data visualization |
| SQL                     | Extensive database development experience; in recent years pretty equally divided between traditional SQL backends and noSQL data stores |
| JavaScript              | Primarily to support web frontends |
| C                       | For high-performance operations, less often for systems development |
| Perl                    | Extensive use in earlier years, but less often now |
| XML, JSON               | Data representation |
| HTML, CSS               | Web development |

### General Data Science
|                         |                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
|	Analytical Approach     | Machine learning and artificial intelligence; traditional statistics and econometrics |
|	Data Transformation     | Processing, transforming, and merging large, semi-structured data; full extract-transform-load (ETL) process
| Data Types              | Accounting, financial, operational, and natural language (NLP) |
|	Statistical Tools       | Primarily R for traditional statistics; Python for machine learning; Stata occasionally |
|	Data Visualization      | ggplot2 when possible; matplotlib when in Python |

### Development Environment
|                         |                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Operating System        | I feel most comfortable in a Linux environment, although I also use Windows regularly |
| IDE                     | I use RStudio when coding R, vim for everything else |
